# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in the Seeed AI Skills project! This document explains how to contribute new skills or improve existing skills in this repository.

## Skill Directory Structure Standard

Each skill should follow this directory structure:

```
skills/{skill-name}/
├── SKILL.md                  # Main skill definition file (required)
├── README.md                 # Skill overview and usage guide (required)
├── CHANGELOG.md              # Version history (required)
├── LICENSE                   # License file (required)
├── .skillrc                  # Skill configuration file (optional)
├── references/               # Detailed reference documentation (recommended)
│   └── *.md                 # Detailed docs for each module
└── scripts/                  # Automation scripts (optional)
    └── *.sh, *.py           # Maintenance and validation scripts
```

### Required Files Description

#### SKILL.md
- Core skill definition file containing key information needed by AI assistants
- Should include: capability descriptions, quick reference, API index, usage examples
- Use progressive disclosure: core workflows + links to detailed API references

#### README.md
- Developer-facing overview documentation
- Should include: skill introduction, supported products, main features, installation methods, quick start examples
- Clearly state maintainer information and repository address

#### CHANGELOG.md
- Record all version change history
- Use semantic versioning (vX.Y.Z)
- Each version entry should include: version number, release date, categorized changes (Added/Fixed/Improved/Breaking Changes)

#### LICENSE
- Each skill should have its own license file
- MIT License is recommended
- If based on other projects, acknowledge original authors and retain original copyright notices

## Skill Naming Conventions

- **Function-oriented naming**: Focus on functionality or technology, e.g., `cv181x-media`, `grove-sensors`
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens: `skill-name`, avoid underscores or camelCase
- Avoid product-specific prefixes unless there's a clear need for product line differentiation

## Version Management Guidelines

### Semantic Versioning

Follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** (x.Y.0): Backward-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH** (x.y.Z): Backward-compatible bug fixes

### Git Tag Format

Each skill uses an independent tag namespace:

```bash
skills/{skill-name}/vX.Y.Z
```

Examples:
```bash
skills/cv181x-media/v2.3.0
skills/grove-sensors/v1.0.0
```

Creating tags:
```bash
git tag -a skills/cv181x-media/v3.0.0 -m "Release cv181x-media v3.0.0"
git push origin skills/cv181x-media/v3.0.0
```
